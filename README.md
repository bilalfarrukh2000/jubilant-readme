# jubilant-readme

## Description
I have created an open source project that displays a high-quality readme file. The application describes how to install it and other details regarding the contributors as well as the third-party assets involved.

When a user opens the terminal and runs node index.js, a list of questions appear one by one.

After the user answers each question, the readme file is generated.
